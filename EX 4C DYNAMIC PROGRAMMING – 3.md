## AIM:
Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.





## Algorithm
1. Reverse the original string to get a second string v.
2. Initialize a 2D dp table of size (m+1) x (n+1) with zeros.
3. For each character pair (u[i-1], v[j-1]), if they match, set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.
4. If characters don't match, set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).
5. Return dp[m][n], which contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

## Program:
